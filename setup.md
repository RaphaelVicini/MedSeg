Setup of the app

The setup will normaly be made by a informatician that knows how terminal and informatic stuff works, this section will not be made for medecins.

Firstly in the medseg_main folder you have to run the setup.py with this command:
'''bash
PATH_TO_medseg_main python3 setup.py
'''

once it is executed,  the IP adress of the servor will be added in some files 'paramters.json' and 'config.js' to be used in other functionnalities. After that the 
different docker images will be loaded on the new machine.
