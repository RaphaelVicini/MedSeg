# Building the Model

To train a model, you need to first prepare your dataset by categorizing the images and their corresponding masks. If the mask name isn't chosed in the uploading step, the user can rename it (if needed) by following those instructions.

## Categorizing Your Data:

1. **Indicators on the Dashboard**:  
   After uploading the files and their respective masks, you'll notice a small downward arrow (v). Hovering over this arrow reveals a "1."

3. **Setting Training Data**:  
   To designate an image for the training set, rename the "1" to "train."  with right click
  

4. **Setting Validation Data**:  
   For the validation set, rename the "1" to "validate."with right click

5. **Visual Confirmation**:  
   Once categorized, images set for training will turn green, while those for validation will turn orange.

Congratulations! You've successfully partitioned your dataset into training and validation sets.
